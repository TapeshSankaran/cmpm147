				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment introduced me to glitch as well as more github features, as well as how to make a word generator. This particular experiment implements a “bad” super power generator, which follows a 2-3 sentence template that describes a super power. The inspiration for this is from shows and movies I have watched such as Invincible and The Boys. The template itself is based off of the movie Shazam.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Th generator has a template with slots that have a specific id. The id determines which list to randomly choose a word from. Doing this results in a completed template that reveals a super power at the end.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The overall difficulty of this experiment was not very hard. The biggest thing I struggled with was figuring out enough words that work within the constraints of the template. The general quality of the generator highly relies on the number of options per list, so it was very important to have a large amount of words in each list. However, it is also important that each word works with the grammar and the meaning of each sentence, leading to more difficulty. Other than that, it was fun to work on the website’s CSS to fit my own style.
